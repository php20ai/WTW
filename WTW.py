    # cumalative development values, then create a seperate worksheet such that in 
    # the 1st row it has the earliest origin year and the maximum number of development years
   # then in the consecutive rows, thier will be the product name in the first column, then the cumulative of the claims paid at each development year, then I would convert
   # this worksheet into a csv file, hence this will be the output.
